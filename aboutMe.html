    <p class="hello">
        welcome to my website! üôãüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
        <br>

        My name is Justice and I am a Digital Marketer with a passion for learning, building, and problem-solving. I
        studied media production at Coventry University, where I honed my creative skills and developed a love for all
        things digital.

        As someone who is always seeking new challenges, I have recently embarked on a journey to become a Front-end
        Developer. I am excited to learn new programming languages, build dynamic websites, and contribute to the
        ever-growing world of web development.
        <br>
        As a beginner, I am well aware that the path to becoming an expert in this field requires a great deal of
        dedication, hard work, and continuous learning. That's why I am always on the lookout for new resources and
        tools to improve my skills. Whether it's attending webinars, researching new techniques, collaborating with
        other developers, or simply practicing, I am committed to expanding my knowledge and improving my craft.
        <br>
        My ultimate goal is to become a master at creating beautiful, user-friendly websites that are both aesthetically
        pleasing and highly functional. I believe that the combination of my creative skills and technical know-how will
        enable me to make a significant impact in the world of web development.
        <br>
        Thank you for taking the time to visit my website and learn a little bit about me. I invite you to join me on
        this exciting journey as I continue to learn, grow, and create! üöÄ
